## Rust
(Except linux only alloy): GC. Faster dev cycle due to compilation

## JS
#no_typing

## TS
no $compile_time_macros (bun is an exception)
Slower than compiled languages even thought close or good
enough (example vscode).
But you would not use JS to write a database

## Java(Kotlin)
No type classes, not every case fits OO

## Python
Missing out on: #compiles_to_js
Complex binary packaging when adding GUI breaking your app

## Ruby
    Slow

## PHP
Missing out on: #compiles_to_js
Doesn't run fast in browser (possible using Webassembly though)

## Lua
Jitting not supported on all platforms
